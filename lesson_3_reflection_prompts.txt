1.) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    You would want to use a remote repository to keep collaboration, or personal, projects organzied. It is also a nice way to get feed back on your work from an online community. And as an extra bonus you can get inspiration from looking at other people's projects as well. 
2.) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually ensures that the content that you're pulling from an online repository are the portions that you actually want to use in your project. For instance, if you were working on a game with a friend or co-worker and they were developing an easy mode and you were developing a normal mode then you wouldn't want git to start automatically pulling content from the easy mode and screw up the version that you were working on. Being able to control when content is pulled and merged is very important to creating a working, production-level project.
