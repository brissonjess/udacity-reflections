1.) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    You would want to use a remote repository to keep collaboration, or personal, projects organzied. It is also a nice way to get feed back on your work from an online community. And as an extra bonus you can get inspiration from looking at other people's projects as well. 
2.) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Pulling changes manually ensures that the content that you're pulling from an online repository are the portions that you actually want to use in your project. For instance, if you were working on a game with a friend or co-worker and they were developing an easy mode and you were developing a normal mode then you wouldn't want git to start automatically pulling content from the easy mode and screw up the version that you were working on. Being able to control when content is pulled and merged is very important to creating a working, production-level project.
3.) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks: Forks are Github's method of cloning repositories between other Github members. This allows for the easy sharing and collaboration of projects. 
	Clones: Clones are a copy of a repository on your local machine. You can clone a local repository or one from online or on Github. 
	Branches: Branches are a division of your repository. They allow you to work on different segments of a project without affecting the master production file. 
	It would be good to use a branch when you want to test or add a new feature to a project. You would want to clone a repository when you want to work on a project on your local machine. And it would be great to Fork a repository when you want to add to a project that you found online. 
4.) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Have the last known state of a remote stored locally allows you to backup your work and ensure that you and your collaborators are working on an up to date file.
